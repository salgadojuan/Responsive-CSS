         <h1>Jiu Jitsu</h1>
        
            <p>Jiu Jitsu, derived from Japanese means "gentle art" is a predominantly ground-based martial art
               that focuses on leverage, angles, timing, and knowledge of human anatomy rather than brute-strength to achieve 
               a gentle non-striking submission of one's opponent. Jiu Jitsu does not enforce punches or kicks but 
               rather close contact grappling and the application of chockes and joint manipulation.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <div class="feature">
            <h3>Healthier Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>Jiu Jitsu combines resistance, cardiovascular, and flexibility in just one session. This tyoe of workout
                often leads individuals to want to clean up thier eating habits to maintain a high level of movement so that 
                they do not feel sick on the Jiu Jitsu mats, this with the combined excercise of Jiu Jitsu often leads to 
                weight loss, higher cardiovascular thresholds, and functional strength all which result in a healthier lifestyle.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <h3>Self Confidence</h3>
            <p>Jiu Jitsu practitioners who commit to the art have a high sense of confidence that applies to their
                daily lives, the reason for that is Jiu Jitsu is very challenging and all practioners start as a with zero skills
                in the mat, learning requires many hours of drilling movement, higher levels of cardio to maintain a practice, 
                and the limitless techniques and positions just to start undeerstanding the art. Many young practitioners often practice
                for years at a time to get promoted to the next belt with the average black belt taking 10 years of daily training.
                This marathon paced vigorous endeavor promotes self confidence as most practioners understand that we all start
                off as beginners and with resiliance in their choosen fields they can attain higher levels of skill.
            </p>

        <div class="feature">
            <h3>Cognitive Changes</h3>
            <p>Jiu Jitsu releases endorphins - "the bodys natural opioid pain relivers" which helps us feel less
                stressed, enegergized, and happier. The art also releases dopamine - "the reward and motivational"
                neurochemical, dopamine helps us feel a sense of achievement from the difficult minor victories on the 
                Jiu Jitsu mats. The art also helps release oxytocin and endogenous oplolds which are the love hormones and 
                positive social connectivity with others as practioners hold eachother in positions and grip or lock hands. 
                All these neurochemical releases impact an individuals life in every aspect from reducing stress to a boost 
                in life satisfaction.
